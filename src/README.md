## Build using:
`g++ -g -Wall -o serial serial.cpp`

## Execute with:
`./serial [numLines]`
- numLines is the number of lines to read from `tracks_features.csv` (useful for quick debugging)
Keep numLines empty to read all lines 

## Run visualization with:
`python python/visualize.py`
- **Must install the libraries in `python/requirements` installed first**
