# The Genre Reveal Party.  

## Tasks

1. setup
   1. readme for executing and build instructions
   2. serial implementation
   3. validation function
   4. visualization
2. parallel implementations
   1. shared memory
      1. CPU
      2. GPU
   2. distrubuted memory
      1. CPU
      2. GPU - some use of CPU code
3. scaling study experiments comparing implementations
   1. serial vs shared mem CPU vs shared mem GPU
      - dont need a scaling study for GPUs
      - instead look at different block/tile sizes
   2. distributed mem CPU vs distributed mem GPU

## Some challenges we forsee

- the setup section needs to be completed in order
  - we can't let ourselves get roadblocked for any significant amount of time 
- the time it will take us to do the scaling studies is unknown as of now
  - we are planning for a week but are unsure how much time we will really need

## Division of work

- section 1 - setup
  - this section will be split based on estimated time
    - one person may have more small tasks
- section 2 - parallel implementation
  - each of us will take two implementations
- section 3 - scaling study experiments
  - each of us will take one of the studies

## Timeline

The work will be divided into three sections: the setup, parallel implementations, and the scaling study experiments.  The work in each section will be divided as evenly as possible in terms of estimated time/effort.  As a group we will agree on a split of the work before we start that section.

The first section will be completed in a week.  The section section we will plan for two weeks, and the last will be week, this leaves us half a week to review and make sure everything is in order to be submitted on December 6th.
