# Spotify Analysis, Parallel Implementation Comparison

## Overview

This project aims to implement a parallel K-Means clustering algorithm to categorize a dataset of 1.2 million songs from Spotify using various metrics provided. The algorithm is designed to work flexibly with different numbers of clusters (K), allowing users to experiment and visualize the clustering behavior based on their selected value of K.

## Requirements

- C++11 or greater
- Python >3.10
- Python Libraries:
  - PyQt5
  - pandas
  - vispy

## Usage

*All files should be run from the root directory (Non script files may be run from `src`)*

1. Run `scripts/build.sh` to build your desired implementation
2. Run `src/python/visualize.py` to visualize results of your implementation
