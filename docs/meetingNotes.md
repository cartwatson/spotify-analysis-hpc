# Meeting Notes

Tasks
- [X] investigate new ways to feed in csv to c++
  - without using header file
- [X] validation
  - may need fixing later depending on file similarities
- [x] visualization
  - matplotlib as a failsafe
    - may be an issue with number of points
  - [ ] investigate other libraries that utilize GPU
